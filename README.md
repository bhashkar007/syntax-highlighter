## Syntax Highlighter Overview

**Syntax Highlighter Setting**

[Prism](https://prismjs.com) is one of the most popular syntax highlighters that widely used by a lot of blog or websites due to it's ability to do custom builds of the language highlighter and plugins you want to be used. 

This plugin helps you to similarly build Prism files by selecting desired languages, plugins and theme and then finally bring  code highlighter in frontend with a single line of code. 

Plugin setting page has 178 languages, 8 themes & 4 plugins to select from. Once you choose desired languages, theme and plugins, the plugin builds a JS and CSS file based on the selection which is then automatically fetched when called in frontend.
